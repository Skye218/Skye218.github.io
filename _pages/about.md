<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm currently a senior student in China Pharmaceutical Univeristy. I majoy in Medicinal Chemistry and I'll get my Bachelor's Degree in 2025. From my point of view, progressing in Pharmaceutical Science demands a commitment to research and staying at the cutting edge of drug discovery, development, and delivery. I Familiarize myself with recent advancements in genomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics, as they increasingly play a role in drug development.

[Discovery of FLT3-targeting PROTACs with potent antiproliferative activity against acute myeloid leukemia cells harboring FLT3 mutations](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2024.116237)

Zhijie Wang\*, Xun Lu\*, **Canlin Liu\***(co-first author), Fei Huang, Tao Lu, Yadong Chen, Lifei Liu, Shuai Lu

- A FLT3 PROTAC molecule 35 with novel structure was discovered.
- Comparative MD simulations elucidated the mechanism of 35 to stabilize the FLT3‚Äî35‚ÄîCRBN ternary complex.
- The ‚Äúzipper‚Äù mechanism of 35 was first proposed in the field of PROTACs.
- 35 possessed selective antiproliferative activities against FLT3-mutated AML cells.

[Rational discovery of dual FLT3/HDAC inhibitors as a potential AML therapy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115759)

Zhijie Wang, Donglin Wu, Xiaofei Zhao, **Canlin Liu**, Siming Jia, Qindi He, Fei Huang, Zitian Cheng, Tao Lu, Yadong Chen, Yun Chen, Pei Yang, Shuai Lu

- New therapies are urgently needed for patients with AML.
- Dual FLT3/HDAC inhibitors were got by structure design strategy for the first time.
- 63 effectively inhibited the proliferation of MV4-11 cells.
- Antitumor activity was dependent on the dual inhibition of FLT3 and HDAC1.
